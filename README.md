# Avalunche

A Clojure library designed to push large numbers of randomly generated Puppet reports into PuppetDB.

It is very rough-and-ready: the code is not production quality and there are lots of limitations. You have almost no
control over behaviour except to specify the PuppetDB instance and the number of nodes/reports you want to create. 
Super basic hardcoded facts and catalogs are also included.

## Usage

To create reports on a PuppetDB instance located at http://localhost:8080:

    lein run <number-of-distinct-nodes> <number-of-reports-per-nodes>

To create 48 reports for each of 20 nodes, for a total of 960 reports:

    e.g. lein run 20 48

Avalunche supports 3 modes of operation:
 * ":fast" (the default) - Sends one set of facts and one catalog per node even if there are many reports
 * ":realistic" - Sends facts and catalog for each and every report
 * ":report-only"  - Never sends facts or catalogs, which can be useful for refreshing an already loaded system in the shortest time

Specify mode as a third argument:

    lein run <number-of-distinct-nodes> <number-of-reports-per-nodes> <mode>

    e.g. lein run 20 48 :report-only

To populate a PuppetDB instance located elsewhere, specify a fourth argument:

    lein run <number-of-distinct-nodes> <number-of-reports-per-nodes> <mode> <optional-puppetdb-prefix>

    e.g. lein run 20 48 :fast http://pe:8080

Only the http interface of PuppetDB is supported, not https. By default in PE, PuppetDB only listens on localhost. If you want to use a remote PuppetDB, then you probably need to update the host setting in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/conf.d/jetty.ini` e.g.:

    host = 0.0.0.0

In Puppet Enterprise, you can configure this in the PE PuppetDB group as the `listen_address` parameter and then running puppet.

If you're happy to edit the source you have some more options, which are listed at the top of the core namespace:

    (def average-events-per-report 50)    ; On average, if a report is not unchanged it will have this many events

## Limitations

There are lots of limitations that it would be great to address, in rough order of priority:

* The number of events should be much less than the number of resources but they are currently the same
* Unchanged counts can be negative but shouldn't be
* The randomization thresholds for statuses should be configurable
* Metrics are totally random and consequently are not internally consistent
* Facts are very static - varied selection of facts would be useful
* Node/Resource/File names are unrealistic
* Node/Resource/File names don't vary much in length - very short and very long names would be useful
* The catalog is the simplest possible tree - it should be more complex or of configurable complexity and shape
* The relationship between skipped and failed resources is not correct
* SSL not supported
